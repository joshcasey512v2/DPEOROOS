# CPlus 🧠🔧  
**Learn C++ through hands-on tasks — with a focus on Design Patterns and Reusable Object-Oriented Software.**

---

## 📝 Overview

**CPlus** is an interactive command-line learning tool inspired by [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), designed to help you master **C++** by completing small, practical exercises. 

From the syntax fundamentals to advanced **Design Patterns** and principles of **Reusable Object-Oriented Software**, CPlus is your hands-on guide to writing clean, maintainable C++ code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Task-based interactive learning
- 🛠 Emphasis on software **Design Patterns** (Factory, Observer, Singleton, etc.)
- ♻️ Learn **reusable** and **maintainable** object-oriented programming techniques
- 🧪 Validate your solutions with the built-in checker
- 💥 Easily reset your progress at any time

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus
CPlus doesn’t just teach you how to write **C++** — it helps you understand why great software design matters. Many exercises are based on concepts from the legendary book:

*"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"
— Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (The Gang of Four)*

### You'll explore
**Creational Patterns:** Factory, Singleton, Builder

**Structural Patterns:** Adapter, Composite, Decorator

**Behavioral Patterns:** Observer, Strategy, Command

Each pattern is introduced through a progressive exercise that builds both conceptual and practical knowledge.

## 🖥 Requirements

- A working **C++ compiler** (e.g. `g++`)
- **Windows PowerShell**
- Git (for cloning the repository)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/joshcasey512v2/DPEOROOS.git
   cd DPEOROOS

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

To begin your journey:

```powershell
cplus 
```
This will launch the interactive CLI where you'll be guided through tasks. Each task contains a description and a C++ file to edit. Once you’ve made your changes, CPlus will attempt to compile and test your solution.

---

## 🔁 Reset Progress
To wipe your progress and start fresh:

```powershell
cplus -reset
```
This will reset all completed tasks and restore the exercise files to their original state.
